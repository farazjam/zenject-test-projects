# zenject-test-projects
Example Projects using Zenject to have more clarity and understanding. 
As the ones that come along are already dense enough to confuse or repel newbies

## Installation
- Make an empty unity project, setup scripting backend to IL2CPP and .Net 4.0
- Do not create any script, try to import [Extenject from Asset store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/extenject-dependency-injection-ioc-157735) first and build it's assemblies
- Edit Tests assembly in Visual Studio may not load, feel free to delete it
- Now you may create your own scripts and use Zenject source files

## Project1: z1-hello-world
- Most basic level hello world in standard unity style and with basic dependency injection
- This helps distinguish how DI (Dependency Injection) and Binding will change things for us
